### **/proc Filesystem**

The `/proc` filesystem (also known as **procfs**) is a **virtual filesystem** in Linux. It does not contain real files on disk. Instead, it provides **runtime system information** about the kernel, processes, and hardware.

This filesystem is widely used for:

- Debugging
- System monitoring
- Performance tuning

### **/proc/kallsyms**

`/proc/kallsyms` provides the **symbol table of the Linux kernel**. It lists **kernel symbols** such as functions, variables, and other internal identifiers along with their memory addresses.

It is mainly used for:

- Debugging
- Kernel module development

#### **Relevant Kernel Configuration Options:**

- `CONFIG_KALLSYMS` — Enables the symbol table.    
- `CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL` — Includes all symbols, even unexported ones.
- `/proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict` — Controls the visibility of kernel addresses in `/proc/kallsyms` (for security/hardening).    

#### **Usage in Android Kernel Exploitation**

When performing **Android kernel exploitation** or **porting an exploit** to run on another device, it is often necessary to obtain the **addresses of kernel functions** specific to that device. In such cases, `/proc/kallsyms` becomes an invaluable resource, as it provides a list of kernel symbols along with their memory addresses. This allows exploit developers to easily locate the required functions and adapt their exploits accordingly.

When working with the Android kernel, you typically start by extracting the **boot image** (`boot.img`).

**Boot Image (`boot.img`)**: This is the boot partition of an Android device. It contains the **kernel** and the **ramdisk**, which are essential for booting the system. You can obtain `boot.img` either by extracting it from the official firmware package (factory images, OTA updates, etc.) or by dumping it directly from the device's storage.

#### `abootimg`

It allows you to extract, modify, and repack the boot image, making it an essential tool for rooting, custom ROM development, or kernel modification. 

```bash
sudo apt install abootimg
```

To extract the contents of a boot.img file, use the following command:

```bash
abootimg -x boot.img
```

This will extract the following files:
- `bootimg.cfg`: Configuration file containing boot header information.
- `zImage` (or `Image.gz`): The kernel binary.
- `initrd.img`: The ramdisk (compressed filesystem).
- `second.img` (if present): The second stage bootloader.

To view the header information of a boot.img file, use:
```bash
abootimg -i boot.img
```

This will display details such as:
- Kernel size and load address.
- Ramdisk size and load address.
- Page size.
- Command line parameters.


After making changes to the kernel, ramdisk, or configuration, you can repack the `boot.img` using:

```bash
abootimg --create newboot.img -f bootimg.cfg -k zImage -r initrd.img -s second.img
```


The ramdisk (initrd.img) is typically a compressed CPIO archive. To extract its contents:

```bash
mv initrd.img initrd.cpio.gz
```

Extract the ramdisk:
```bash
mkdir ramdisk
cd ramdisk
gunzip -c ../initrd.cpio.gz | cpio -i
```

Make changes to the ramdisk (e.g., add root scripts).
Repack the ramdisk:
```bash
find . | cpio -o -H newc | gzip > ../initrd.cpio.gz
mv ../initrd.cpio.gz ../initrd.img
```

If you want to replace the kernel (zImage or Image.gz), simply place the new kernel binary in the same directory and repack the boot.img:

```bash
abootimg --create newboot.img -f bootimg.cfg -k new_kernel -r initrd.img
```

For newer devices that use a Device Tree Blob (DTB), you can include it when repacking the boot.img:

```bash
abootimg --create newboot.img -f bootimg.cfg -k zImage -r initrd.img -d dtb
```


`bzImage` is a compressed kernel image used in x86 and x86_64 architectures. It contains the kernel code, compressed using algorithms like gzip, LZMA, or others.

For Linux:
`extract-vmlinux` Script: This script extracts the uncompressed vmlinux from bzImage.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/master/scripts/extract-vmlinux
chmod +x extract-vmlinux
```

For Android:
`vmlinux-to-elf`:
This tool allows to obtain a fully analyzable ELF file from a vmlinux/vmlinuz/bzImage/zImage kernel image (either a raw binary blob or a preexisting but stripped ELF file), with recovered function and variable symbols.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip liblzo2-dev
sudo pip3 install --upgrade lz4 zstandard git+https://github.com/clubby789/python-lzo@b4e39df
sudo pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/marin-m/vmlinux-to-elf
```

It produces an ELF file that you can analyze using IDA Pro and Ghidra. This tool is hence useful for embedded systems reverse engineering.


```bash
vmlinux-to-elf bzImage vmlinux
```

Once vmlinux is generated now you can extract kallsyms.

```bash
kallsyms-finder vmlinux > kallsyms
```
