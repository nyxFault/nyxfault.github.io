In the quest for robust operating system security, **fuzz testing (fuzzing)** plays a vital role. Among the most advanced tools in this domain is **Syzkaller**, a coverage-guided kernel fuzzer designed specifically for the **Linux kernel** (though it supports others as well). Syzkaller is highly automated, capable of generating complex syscall programs, and is widely used in both academia and industry, including by Google’s Project Zero.

In this blog, we’ll deep-dive into what Syzkaller is, how it works, and how you can set it up to fuzz a kernel effectively.
