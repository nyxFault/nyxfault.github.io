ARM processors support multiple instruction sets, including the **ARM instruction set** (a fixed 32-bit instruction set) and **Thumb instruction sets** (which primarily use 16-bit instructions but can also include 32-bit instructions in Thumb-2). The Thumb instruction sets provide a more compact representation of ARM instructions, improving code density while maintaining performance.

## Thumb Mode: 16-bit vs. 32-bit Instructions

**Thumb mode** was introduced to reduce the memory footprint of applications by using 16-bit instructions instead of the traditional 32-bit ARM instructions. Thumb mode provides a subset of ARM instructions but offers increased efficiency, especially in memory-constrained environments (e.g., embedded systems and mobile devices).

| Feature                | ARM Mode (A32)                       | Thumb Mode (T16)                     | Thumb-2 (T32)                       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Instruction Size      | 32-bit                               | 16-bit                               | Mixed 16-bit & 32-bit               |
| Code Density          | Lower                                | Higher (Better for memory-limited systems) | Higher                              |
| Instruction Set       | Full ARM instruction set             | Limited subset of ARM                | Almost full ARM instruction set      |
| Performance           | High                                 | Generally lower but efficient        | High                                |
| Use Case              | Performance-critical applications     | Code size reduction                  | Balance of performance and size     |


## **Switching Between ARM and Thumb Mode (`BX`, `BLX`)**

Since ARM and Thumb use different instruction encodings, special instructions (`BX` and `BLX`) are used to switch between them dynamically.

### **1. `BX` (Branch and Exchange) Instruction**

- Used to switch between **ARM and Thumb states**.
- If the least significant bit (LSB) of the target address is **1**, execution switches to Thumb mode.
- If the LSB is **0**, execution remains in ARM mode.

#### **Example: Switching to Thumb Mode**

```s
MOV R0, #1      // Load value 1 into R0
BX  R0          // Switch to Thumb mode (because LSB is 1)
```


### **2. `BLX` (Branch with Link and Exchange) Instruction**

- Similar to `BX` but also stores the return address (used for function calls).
- Allows calling a function written in a different mode (ARM â†” Thumb).

#### **Example: Calling a Thumb Function from ARM**

```s
BLX Function_Thumb    // Branch to Thumb function and switch mode
```

## **Thumb-2 Extensions (T32 Instruction Set)**

**Thumb-2** was introduced in ARMv6T2 and later architectures to bridge the gap between ARM and Thumb. It extends the **16-bit Thumb** instruction set by allowing a mix of **16-bit and 32-bit** instructions, making it more powerful while still maintaining high code density.

### **Key Features of Thumb-2**

- **Uses both 16-bit and 32-bit instructions** for better performance.
- **Expands the available instruction set**, making it almost equivalent to full ARM.
- **Maintains backward compatibility with Thumb (T16).**

### **Example of Thumb-2 Code**

```s
MOVS R0, #5     // 16-bit instruction
ADD  R1, R0, R2 // 32-bit instruction in Thumb-2
```

**Example: Mixing ARM and Thumb Code**

**ARM Code**

```s
.global main
main:
    BLX thumb_function  ; Call a Thumb function
    B   main            ; Loop
```

**Thumb Code**

```s
.thumb
.thumb_func
.global thumb_function
thumb_function:
    MOV R0, #42
    BX  LR              ; Return to ARM mode
```
