### **NEON SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) â€“ Vector Operations**

**NEON** is an advanced **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** extension for ARM processors that provides hardware-accelerated vector processing. SIMD allows a single instruction to perform the same operation on multiple data elements simultaneously, leading to significant performance improvements for data-parallel tasks like multimedia processing, signal processing, and scientific computing.

#### **Key Features of NEON**

- **Wide Register Set**: NEON uses a set of 32 registers (V0-V31), each capable of holding 128-bit data. These registers can be used for both integer and floating-point operations.
- **Parallelism**: NEON performs operations on vectors of data (e.g., multiple integers or floats) in parallel, allowing for high throughput and efficiency.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: NEON can process data in parallel, improving throughput in applications like video encoding, audio processing, and cryptography.

#### **NEON Data Types**

NEON supports various data types and operations. The supported data types include:

- **8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit integers** (signed and unsigned)
- **Single-precision floating-point numbers** (32-bit)

#### **Common NEON Operations**

NEON provides a rich set of vector operations, including:

- **Addition/Subtraction**: `VADD`, `VSUB`
- **Multiplication**: `VMUL`
- **Dot product**: `VDOT`
- **Shifting and packing**: `VSHL`, `VZIP`

#### **Example: NEON Vector Addition**

The following is an example of adding two vectors using NEON instructions:

```s
VLD1.32 {D0-D1}, [R0]     // Load vector A (128 bits) into D0-D1
VLD1.32 {D2-D3}, [R1]     // Load vector B (128 bits) into D2-D3
VADD.F32 D4, D0, D2       // Add vectors A and B (element-wise) and store in D4
```

In this example:

- **`VLD1.32`** loads the 128-bit vectors into the registers.
- **`VADD.F32`** adds the corresponding elements of the two vectors (e.g., `A[0] + B[0]`, `A[1] + B[1]`, etc.).
- **`D0-D1`, `D2-D3`** are 64-bit parts of the 128-bit NEON registers (since each NEON register holds 128 bits, which can store multiple elements).


### **Privileged Instructions (SVC, CPS)**

ARM architecture provides privileged instructions for controlling the system's operation, such as system calls, changing processor modes, and controlling interrupt behavior. These instructions allow software to perform high-level tasks like managing security contexts, switching between privilege levels, and handling system services.

#### **SVC (Supervisor Call)**

- **Purpose**: The `SVC` instruction triggers a **software interrupt** to switch the processor to supervisor mode. This allows the application to request a service from the operating system or invoke system-level functionality.
- **Usage**: Typically used in **operating systems** or **bare-metal applications** to interact with the kernel or execute system-level operations.

##### **Example of SVC Usage**

```s
SVC #0              // Trigger a supervisor call with an immediate value of 0
```


When `SVC` is called, the processor saves the current state and jumps to a predefined address (usually an interrupt handler or a specific system service handler).


#### **CPS (Change Processor State)**

- **Purpose**: The `CPS` instruction is used to modify the processor's state, such as enabling or disabling interrupts and changing the current processor mode.
- **Usage**: Often used to manipulate the interrupt flags and set the **IRQ** (Interrupt Request) or **FIQ** (Fast Interrupt Request) modes.

##### **Common CPS Instructions**

- **`CPSID`**: Disable interrupts (`CPSID` stands for "Change Processor State and Disable interrupts").
- **`CPSIE`**: Enable interrupts (`CPSIE` stands for "Change Processor State and Enable interrupts").
- **`CPS`** can also change between **user mode** and **privileged modes** (e.g., `SVC`, `IRQ`, `FIQ`).


Example of CPS Instruction

```s
CPSID I            // Disable interrupts (I = IRQ mask)
```

This instruction disables interrupts in the ARM processor, ensuring no IRQs are handled until re-enabled.


### **Exception Handling (SWI, IRQ, FIQ)**

ARM processors have an efficient mechanism for handling exceptions (such as interrupts, system calls, and software exceptions). The **exception handling** system in ARM includes a variety of exception types that are invoked under different conditions. These exceptions can trigger **interrupt handlers**, **software interrupt handlers**, or **system services**.

#### **Types of Exceptions**

- **SWI (Software Interrupt)**: A software exception triggered by the `SWI` instruction. It is used for **system calls** in a system, allowing user-mode programs to request services from the operating system.
- **IRQ (Interrupt Request)**: A standard interrupt request triggered by hardware devices. It is used to handle general interrupts in the system (e.g., a timer interrupt).
- **FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request)**: A high-priority interrupt that can preempt IRQs. It is used for time-sensitive operations that require faster response times.

#### **SWI (Software Interrupt)**

- **Purpose**: The `SWI` instruction triggers a software interrupt, typically used to invoke kernel or system-level services.
- **Usage**: Often used in operating systems to transition from user mode to supervisor mode.


##### **Example of SWI Usage**

```s
SWI #1                // Trigger software interrupt with service number 1
```

In this case, the operating system will handle the SWI and execute a specific system call associated with service number 1.


#### **IRQ (Interrupt Request)**

- **Purpose**: The `IRQ` is used to handle regular interrupts, which can be caused by external devices such as timers or peripherals.
- **Usage**: In embedded systems, `IRQ` is triggered by events like GPIO changes, timers, or UART activity.
- **Interrupt Handling**: When an IRQ occurs, the processor saves its state and jumps to the interrupt service routine (ISR) to handle the interrupt.

Example of IRQ Handling

```s
IRQ_Handler:
    ; Handle IRQ interrupt here
    ; Typically used for timer or peripheral interrupts
    MOV R0, #1          ; Some example processing
    SUBS PC, LR, #4     ; Return from interrupt
```


#### **FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request)**

- **Purpose**: The `FIQ` is a high-priority interrupt used for more time-critical operations, ensuring they are processed faster than regular IRQs.
- **Usage**: FIQs are often used for real-time processing tasks, such as handling high-frequency data from sensors or processing fast communication channels.

Example of FIQ Handling

```s
FIQ_Handler:
    ; Handle FIQ interrupt here
    MOV R0, #2          ; Example high-priority processing
    SUBS PC, LR, #4     ; Return from interrupt
```

### **ARM Exception Handling Flow**

- When an exception occurs (whether from `SWI`, `IRQ`, or `FIQ`), the processor saves the current state (Program Counter, CPSR, etc.) and switches to the appropriate mode (Supervisor, IRQ, FIQ).
- The address of the **exception vector** (a predefined location in memory for handling exceptions) is used to jump to the appropriate exception handler.

**ARM Modes During Exceptions**:

- **User Mode**: The normal mode of operation for non-privileged code.
- **Supervisor Mode (SVC)**: A privileged mode for handling exceptions like `SWI` or system calls.    
- **IRQ Mode**: A privileged mode for handling interrupts (IRQ).
- **FIQ Mode**: A high-priority mode for handling fast interrupts (FIQ).
